# Cape assessment

This app is made for Cape. You can see animations and adjust the header, color and image size. 


## Installation

Download or clone the files and install/run the app with npm

```bash
  npm install 
  npm run start
```

## Bugs 

- The image will render behind the background graphic. After research I did not manage to find a solution. Transform does something with z-index that I don't understand. Probably related with: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20851452/z-index-is-canceled-by-setting-transformrotate.
